Instructions
Please complete Labs 1-17 before attempting this assignment.

Following our style_guide.pdf in Resources is particularly important 
for this last specification.

Don't forget to include the output from running your program.

Assignment 3 Lab 17

For this assignment, you have two choices:

1. Write your own application, I am interested in the quality of your code, 
not quantity.  I want to see at least one class definition, 
with __init__ and __str__ defined.  I like to see that you 
understand  the '*' character in Python.  It's nice to see a list 
comprehension, and other devices you learned.  Be sure your code is 
Python, and not your old language translated directly to Python.

2. In our class "Resources", lab.zip has:

labs/lab_17_Developer_Modules/egypt_def.py
labs/lab_17_Developer_Modules/currency_def.py
labs/lab_17_Developer_Modules/japan_def.py
labs/lab_17_Developer_Modules/usa_def.py
labs/lab_17_Developer_Modules/currency_test.py

These are 5 cooperating modules and 4 classes: currency_def.py, the base 
class for any currency for any country in the world; and three country_def.py 
classes that only contain class data for each of the countries.

Notice that there are no methods in the country_def.py classes, only data 
attributes for the class.  This shows a (sometimes) useful oddity in the 
scoping rules of Python.

When referencing an attribute in a object:

print obj.x

if x cannot be found in the obj, and if obj is an object of a class, it will 
reference the class' x.  If it doesn't find the x in the class, 
it will look in the super-classes.

This behavior is reiterated on page 23 of Lab 18.

You have three tasks:

a.  Study the code and run currency_test.py. You'll have to add 
exactly one __init__.py into a particular directory.  Where?

b.  Make another country_def.py, for a country of your choice.

c.  Rewrite currency_test.py to be a unit test.

If you like, you can make your currency_test.py be dynamic, so 
that it finds all the country_def.py's in the directory and 
adjusts the testing so that it tests all that it finds.  No extra 
credit will be given for doing this, but you might find it interesting.
