# MY STRATEGY:
#     Check for illegal characters
#     Check for keywords
#     Check for numbers as the first character
#     Check to see if the first char is a letter or underscore

#------------------------------------------------------------
# check each string for any invalid characters
#
# this could be done more efficiently with a regex ...
# [_A-Za-z0-9] ... or similar
#
# but I didn't want to work too far ahead .... so
# brute force it is!
#
# also, while the string 'x,y ' has two invalid characters,
# the comma and the space, this check is going to bomb out
# as soon as the first bad character is found
